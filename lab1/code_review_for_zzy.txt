The codes are well structured but with some problems when sharing on the cloud.

1. The codes rely on a local file directory "home/geekgao". I think it would be better to put the files into the repo. If the files are not willing to share, maybe an explanation in the readme would also work.
2. Some syntax is not work in my environment, for example, "except Exception, e" comes with a syntax error and should be "except Exception as e".
3. Although the codes are quite clear, some HTML sentences are used which could be explained with comments.
4. I think it would be better to write more about the project in the readme files. For example, what does each file stand for?
