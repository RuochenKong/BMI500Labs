This code could be implemented quickly with the help of developer's instructions. The introductions of all the documents and codes are clearly and easily expressed, which helps understand the project. 

In util.py file, codes are divided into sections with individual tasks. All the sections are commented with the main task implemented. The sections are sequenced in a comprehensible way and all the adjacent sections are related, helping understand the logic behind the codes. Most of the variables are named with understandable naming inventions, including capitalizing the constant variables, naming variables with lower case and no short or unmeaningful variables.

There are some aspects to be improved in this python file. Though most of the variables are named well in this code, naming more variables with CamelCase conventions would make the codes easier to understand. Besides, prefix naming convention is also a great strategy to apply. For the structure of the codes, additional explanations of the sections would make the structures clearer. Moreover, a summary of this code could help explicitly express the overall function of the code. In-line comments that specifically explain details of some code could also improve the quality of the code.
